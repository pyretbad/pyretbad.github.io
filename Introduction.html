    <h1> VALORANT</h1>
    <p> Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it.</p>

    <h2> Agent Roles</h2>  
    <table border="1" style="width: 100%; text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse; margin-top: 20px;">

                </td>
                <td>Duelists are self-sufficient killers with abilities that help them in offense. They are required to start fights, look for high-frag opportunities, and excel in aggressive and fast-paced situations. The importance of individual dueling cannot be understated in Valorant, and the Duelist does this best.</td>

                </td>
                <td>Initiators are designed to create opportunities for their team by disrupting enemies and providing valuable information. They are crucial during both attacking and defending phases, using their abilities to gather intel, blind opponents, and control key areas of the map.</td>

                    Sentinels are defensive experts who play a critical role in locking down areas and preventing flanks in Valorant. Not having a sentinel on your team leaves you vulnerable to enemy flanks and makes it easier for them to secure bomb sites.</td>
                <td>Female Dominant</td>

                </td>
                <td>As the name of the role implies, controllers are responsible in controlling the map. Their proficiency lies in manipulating the flow of rounds since their abilities not only obscure vision but also restrict the opposing team's access to crucial information.</td>
                <td>Equally dominant</td>
