                <h1><em>Why I like the game(in 100~ words) </em></h1>
                <p>
                    I like the game Valorant made by the company Riot Games as I enjoy tactical FPS games. Valorant's blend of tactical shooting and agent abilities intrigues me as it is not just pure aim but also with the involvement of signature abilities. Additionally, I also like it as a 5v5 team game, as it allows me to play the game with my peers, creating sometimes fun, sometimes horrible memories together. The various agents in Valorant make the game not boring to one as you can just start learning another agent once you finish mastering an agent. Overall, Valorant's blend of skill and strategy makes it a consistently enjoyable gaming experience, definitely a game I would recommend to anyone who is starting on FPS shooter games.
